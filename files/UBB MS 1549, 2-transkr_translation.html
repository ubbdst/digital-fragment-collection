            <div class="translation"><h2>Antiphon</h2><p>O my people, what I have done to you? or how have I burdened you? Answer me.</p></div>
            <div class="translation"><h2>Verse</h2><p>Because he led you out of the land of Egypt, you have prepared a cross for your saviour.</p>
<p>O holy God! O holy strong one! O holy immortal one, have mercy on us.</p>
                <p>O holy god! O holy strong one! O holy and immortal one, have mercy on us.
                </p>
                <p>Because I led you through the desert forty years and fed you with manna, and brought you into a land exceeding good, you have prepared a cross for your saviour. </p>
                <p>O holy. O holy.</p>
                <p>What more ought I have done for you, that I have not done? I planted you, indeed, my most beautiful vineyard, and you have become exceeding bitter to me: For in my thirst you gave me vinegar to drink, and with a lance you pierced the side of your saviour. </p>
                <p>O holy. O holy.</p>For online translation, see http://www.christusrex.org/www1/mcitl/trholyweek.html or http://www.cantemusdomino.net/blog/archives/001209.php.</div>
            <div class="translation"><h2>Responsory</h2><p>Behold the wood of the cross, on which hung the saviour of the world, come let us adore. Come let us adore him, because he is the Lord, our God. Behold the wood. God have mercy. Behold the wood.</p></div>
            <div class="translation"><h2>Antiphon</h2>
                <p>Let us adore your cross, Lord, let us adore, Lord, and honour your glorious passion. Have mercy on us, you who suffered for us. We adore your cross, O Lord, we praise and glorify your holy resurrection. For behold, by the wood of the Cross joy came into the whole world.</p></div>
            <div class="translation"><h2>Antiphon</h2>
                <p>While the maker of the world suffered the punishment of death on the cross, crying out loudly, he gave up his spirit, and behold, the veil was ripped, the graves were opened, for there was a strong tremor, because the world cried out that it could not stand the death of the son of God. O admirable ransom, by the weight of which the darkness’ captivity of the world was abolished, the walls of hell were crushed, and the gates of the kingdom opened for us.</p>For online translation, see http://www.bl.uk/collections/eblj/2004/pdfarticles/article1.pdf, p. 3..

                <div class="translation"><p>O Lord, Jesus Christ, I adore you climbing onto the cross, I implore you, that this very cross will liberate me from the striking devil.</p>
                <p>O Lord, Jesus Christ, I adore you wounded on the cross, I implore you, that these very wounds will be a remedy for my soul.</p>
                <p>O Lord, Jesus Christ, I adore you placed in the sepulchre, I implore you that your very death will be life for me.</p>
                <p>O Lord, Jesus Christ, I adore you descending to hell, releasing the captives, I implore you, that you will not send me away to enter there. </p>
                <p>O Lord, Jesus Christ, I adore you when you come to pass judgement, I implore you, that when you come, you will not pass judgement on me as a sinner, but I implore you that you will not send me away before you judge. The saviour of the world, who, with the eternal God, the Father. For ever and ever.</p></div>

                    <h2>Prayer</h2><p>God, I who venerate your cross and believe in your holy resurrection, O Christ, saviour of the world, you who have redeemed me with your precious blood, hanging on the cross for us on this day, I beseech you, save me, this sinner who bowing to the ground humbly worships you and confesses to you, honouring your sorrowful Passion on the cross, and praising and devoutly believing in your holy resurrection. Submissively confessing and bowing to the ground we humbly venerate the wooden instrument of your most holy Passion.</p></div>

                <p>O Lord, almighty holy Father, the ever-shining light, the maker of all light, hear us, your servants, and bless this fire, which will be consecrated by your sanctification and blessing; you, who illuminate every man who comes into this world, illuminate our heart’s conscience with the fire of your clarity, so that we, alight with your fire and illuminated by your light, with the darkness of sin expelled from our hearts, deserve to reach the eternal life by your guiding light.</p>
                <p>O God, you who brought your Son, the corner stone, the fire of love, to those who believe in you, brought forth to our benefit, bless this new fire and let us through this Easter celebration be inflamed by celestial desires, so that we may reach the eternal celebration with pure minds.</p></div>

                <p>Let the flock of angels rejoice, let the divine mysteries rejoice, and for the victory of so great a king let the trumpet of salvation sound. Let the earth rejoice, made radiant with such gleaming light and enlightened by the splendour of the eternal king, let it feel that the darkness of the whole world is expelled. Be glad, mother church, adorned with such brightness, and let this hall resound from the strong voices of the people. Therefore, dearest brothers, as you stand by the amazing clarity of his holy light, I ask, invoke with me the mercy of God, the almighty Father, so that he who by no merit of mine has seen me worthy to be counted among the levites, as the grace of his light flows forth, will enable me to fulfil the praise of this candle. Through our Lord, Jesus Christ his son, who lives and reigns with him, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God; world without end. Amen.</p>
                <p>The Lord be with you. (And with your spirit.) Lift up (your hearts). We have lifted them up to the Lord. Let us give thanks (to the Lord, our God). It is fitting (and just).</p>
                    <p>It is fitting indeed and just, to proclaim with all our hearts and all the affection of our minds, and with the ministry of our voices, the invisible God, the Father Almighty and His Only-begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ with the Holy spirit, who repaid for us to His Eternal Father the debt of Adam, ...
