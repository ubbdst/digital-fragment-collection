            <div class="translation"><h2>Lesson six</h2><p>The victorious and blessed father Botulphus tirelessly walked the regions abandoned and deserted by men, carefully considering all the places around him. Finally he decided upon Ikanho with God’s guidance, to establish a monastic community there, after the suitable buildings had been erected. But this was a wasteland, and after it was left by the Christians it had been possessed by demons. Their deceiving ghosts had to be chased away by the arrival of the many soldiers of Christ, and the pious life of the faithful be introduced, so that this place formerly abounding in the devil’s deceit should abound in the grace of the merciful creator. </p></div>  
            
            <div class="translation"><h2>Lesson seven</h2><p>Upon the arrival of our blessed teacher Botulphus, terrible fumes rose from the ground. Since the whole world is illuminated by your miracles, why did you have to uncover our darkness? You act inhumanely and disregard all piety by driving us poor wretches away also from this deserted region, we who have been chased from all the rest of the world.</p>
