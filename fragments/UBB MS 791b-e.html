         <h1>Description of UB Bergen MS 791, b-e</h1>
         <h2>Justinian's Digest with glosses by Accurtius</h2>
         
         
         <div id="main_fragment">
            <div id="introduction">
               <h2>Introduction</h2>
               <p>MS 791, b-e are from a glossed version of Justinian’s Digest, which was one of
                  the pillars of the Corpus iuris civilis, a collection
                  of laws put together by the emperor Justinian for the Eastern Roman empire
                  during the years 529-534 AD. The digests were extracts from former writings on
                  Roman law. About 2000 books from 39 different authors were used as sources, and
                  the selected items were organized in 50 books. Among the fragments belonging to MS
                  791 we have parts from the books 13 and 14 (fragment d), 17 (e), 18 (c) and 19 (b).
                  
               </p>
               <p>Not much else was known about these fragments until a workshop on manuscript
                  fragments was held in Bergen, in late October 2005. Here the fragments were
                  dated to the 14th century, and identified as a product of the Italian town of
                  Bologna, which in the Middle ages was known for its university and excellence in
                  law-studies. The fragments in the University Library of Bergen most probably
                  came from a manuscript produced by one of the teams working in connection with
                  the University. The name “dominus Accurtius” is mentioned in one of the lower
                  margins of fragment c, referring to Franciscus Accurtius (d. 1260), one of the
                  most famous glossators in Bologna. He compiled his work between 1220 and 1240,
                  and his glosses became standard for the Corpus Iuris Civiles for centuries. We
                  are grateful to David Ganz (London) for the information about the origin of these
                  fragments.

               <p>MS 791, b-e are from a glossed version of Justinian’s digest, a law collection organized
                  in 50 books. Among the fragments belonging to MS 791 are parts from the books 13,
                  14, 17, 18
                  and 19. The glosses are by Franciscus Accurtius (d. 1260), one of the most famous

            <h2>Physical Description</h2>
            <div id="physdesc">
               
               <p>Parchment, four bifolia, leaf size: ca. 42 x 27
                  cm, and two smaller fragments, ca. 6,5 x 9
                  cm.
               </p>
               
               <p>Quires: There are bifolia from four different quires:</p>
               
               <p>Fragment d has the lowest folionumber, f. 186. This bifolium was the
                  first one in its quire of four (a quaternion), starting with f. 186,
                  ending with f. 193, i.e. the three quires going from 187-192 are
                  missing. In the centre of the lower margin of f. 193v is a framed
                  catchword, “liberis”. Next to it is a small roman numeral: lviiii. It
                  seems that the flesh-side of the parchment originally faced outwards in
                  the quire. (Note that the bifolium today is folded the opposite way.)
               </p>
               
               <p>The order of the next fragments are: Fragm. e – c – b. They seem to come
                  from three different quires, going from f. 236-f. 262. Fragment e was
                  the first bifolium in its quire, starting with f. 236. The last
                  folionumber is unfortunately difficult to read. In the centre of the
                  lower margin of the last folio of fragment c is a framed catchword,
                  “exigat”. Next to it is a small roman numeral: xlviiii. It seems that
                  the flesh-side of the parchment originally faced outwards in the quire.
                  (Note that the bifolium today is folded the opposite way.) The fragments
                  c and b seem not to have been the first or last bifolia in their quires.
                  They have no catchwords, and the contents does not indicate that any of
                  the folia are particularly close together. 
               </p>
               
               <p>Lay-out: Two double, “onion-layered” columns: Complete writing space is
                  ca 39 x 23,5 cm. The main text of Justinian, in larger script, appears
                  in two columns of ca 25/26 x 6,5 cm, imbedded in two larger columns of
                  smaller script. The outer column of the gloss-text is ca 39,5 x 12 cm,
                  while the column of the gloss-text closer to the spine is only 10 cm
                  wide. The main text has 48-50 lines, while the glosses have ca 70-90
                  lines to the page. The ruling for the main text seems to be very thin
                  lead ruling (the colour is grey, not the ink-colour). The ruling for the
                  glosses is not visible. 
               </p>
               
               <p> Fragment b is marked XIX on the top of the recto-pages, and L on the
                  verso-pages, in roman red and blue numerals. The number 262 is written
                  above the second recto.
               </p>
               
               <p> Fragment c is marked XIX on the first recto-page, and L on the first
                  verso. The second recto is marked XVIII, with the later number 248 (?)
                  written above it. The marking of the second verso is not visible.
               </p>
               
               <p> Fragment d is marked XIIII on the first recto-page, with the folionumber
                  193 noted above, while the first verso is marked L. The second recto is
                  marked XIII with 186 noted above. The marking of the second verso is not
                  visible.
               </p>
               
               <p> Fragment e: The first recto is marked XVIII. The number above is not
                  readable. The first verso is marked L. The second verso is marked XVII,
                  with the number 236 written above it. 
               </p>
               
               <p> The roman numerals on the recto-side refer to the books from Justinian’s
                  digest, while the arabic numbers above them seem to mark the folia.
                  There are rubrics marking the different chapters in the books. 
               </p>
               
               <p>Script: A southern Gothic textualis formata.</p>
               
               <p>Initials: Two multicoloured initials in very fine execution, with red,
                  pink, light and dark blue, white and gold. In one instance the white
                  plaster can be seen through the gold. The other initials are fleuronnée, mainly blue with red flourishing.
                  The first initial is a G (in Gaius), marking the transition from book
                  14, 1 to 14, 2 (fragm. d, fol. 193v). The second initial is a U (in
                  Ulpianus), marking the transition from book 18, 2 to 18, 3 (fragm. e).
               </p>
               
               <p> Condition: The leaves are cut to serve as book covers, and are quite
                  damaged. The outer sides of the bifolia are very faded, and only very
                  week remnants of script are left, along with some hints of red colour.
                  Going from one side to another are four rectangular holes, ca. 6,5 x 1,5
                  cm, marking the spine of the later covered book. There are also holes
                  from worms or insects. Where the parchment would cover the later spine,
                  fragment b is marked “Baldus”, probably referring to Baldus de Ubaldis.
                  The number 45 is crossed over and below is written the number 15. 
               </p>
               
               <p> Fragment c is marked “Paulus de Castro”, the number 21 (crossed over)
                  and below, 18. 
               </p>
               
               <p> One of two small fragments put together with c is marked “Jacobus Alva
                  rottus super Feudis”, and the number 44 (crossed over).
               </p>
               
               <p> Fragment d is marked “Pars Pauli de Castro”, and the number 26. (crossed
                  over), and below, 15, along the spine of the later binding.
               </p>
               
               <p> For the names referring to the covered books, see secondary provenance.
                  The numbers marking the codices are ca 3,5 cm tall.

            <p>Four of the fragments have the titles of the books they were used to
               bind, on the back, all related to the study of law, like “Baldus”
               [de Ubaldus] who was the teacher of “Paulus de Castro” (see for
               instance <a href="http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/BALDBIO.html">http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/BALDBIO.html</a>). The
               third name is “Jacobus Alvarottus”, whose work is also specified;
               “super Feudis”. The numbers marking the spines of the covered books,
               are in the handwritten catalogue presumed to be 18th century. Later
               the fragments became part of Prof. Hannaas’s collections, which is
               presumably Professor Torleiv Hannaas at the Nordic Institute, the
               University of Bergen. His lecture in 1918 marks the beginning of the
               Nordic institute, see <a href="http://www.hf.uib.no/Institutter/Nordisk/nymappe/forsking/Hannaas.htm">http://www.hf.uib.no/Institutter/Nordisk/nymappe/forsking/Hannaas.htm</a>.
               The library bought 10 000 books from his collection in 1932, see
